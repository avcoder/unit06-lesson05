# Recap
- Q: Why did I use PrimeReact's `severity` prop in last class? (since I can make it work using different prop names, or values)

# Data Binding
Often we want state to bind to a form field

- Exercise: create an input box; whatever is inputted, will display as an h1 on page

# Custom Hooks

- Create a custom hook called `/hooks/useToggle.js` and replace it in our `isFollowing` button
  ```ts
  import { useState } from 'react';

  export default function useToggle(initialValue = false) {
    const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue);
    const toggle = () => setValue(prev => !prev);
    return [value, toggle];
  }
  ```
- Optional, create a "barrel file" `index.js` so that you can import it in a nicer way
  ```js
  // hooks/index.js
  export { default as useToggle } from './useToggle.js';
  export { default as useWhatever } from './useWhatever.js';
  ```

  ```js
  // above allows to nicely import it elsewhere 
  import { useToggle, useWhatever } from '../hooks/index.js';
  ```

# Homework

- Refactor the weather app we did for our first exercise (see https://codepen.io/codevilla/pen/YPyWWpm) into the following components.  Then separate the css into its respective components that you created.
Feel free to create more components inside `<Forecast>` as you see fit.  FYI - ignore my `this.whatever` or `this.state.whatever` code below since I was using class-based React which you won't be using.
  ```jsx
  return (
      <div>
        <header>
          <Nav city={this.state.currentCity} handleCityChange={this.changeCity} />
        </header>
        <main>
          <TodayWeather
            city={this.state.currentCity}
            handleCoordsChange={this.changeCoords}
          />
          <Forecast lat={this.state.lat} lon={this.state.lon} />
        </main>
      </div>
    );
  ```
