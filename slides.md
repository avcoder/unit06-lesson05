# Recap
- Q: Why did I use PrimeReact's `severity` prop in last class? (since I can make it work using different prop names, or values)
- Q: Back in Unit 2, list some examples of browser events (think mouse and keyboard)
- Q: in vanilla JS, how were able to listen to a click event in order to run a function called `doSomething`? 
- see list of [Event Handlers](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/events.html)
   - using React's Event Handlers rather than our own (ex: addEventListener) is good because of: automatic cleanup. (Otherwise if we forget to removeEventListener, there will be a memory leak), improved performance, no DOM interaction via `document.querySelector()`; as React devs, we should avoid interacting with the DOM directly
- when we "set the mouse trap" we have to pass a reference to the function.  Why?
  ```js
  React.createElement(
    'button',
    {
      onClick: doSomething,  // vs. { onClick: doSomething(), }
    }
  ); // Q: What if we need to pass in arguments to the function?
  ```

# Exercise: onClick

1. Handle Events via onClick: if a user clicks "Toronto", "Moscow" or "Tokyo" have it console log that city
2. Lift State up: Make clicked city set the parent's state to that city and display it in an `<h1>` from the parent scope

# Forms and Data Binding
Often we want state to bind to a form field

- create an input box; if we type in the input box what happens?
- try setting `value="hello world"` in input tag (value is like a üîí)
   - try typing or deleting the text in the input box - what happens?
- implement a useState with an initial value of "hi"
   - make that text appear as the input box's value
- implement a button that sets text to `Math.random()` when clicked
   - when you click button, value gets set == this is one-way data binding where JS changes variable, and thus UI reflects that
- To get 2-way data binding, add an `onChange` on the input to `console.log(e.target.value)`
   - now make it set state instead - what happens now when you type in the input box?

# Custom Hooks

- Create a custom hook called `/hooks/useToggle.js` and replace it in our `isFollowing` button
  ```ts
  import { useState } from 'react';

  export default function useToggle(initialValue = false) {
    const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue);
    const toggle = () => setValue(prev => !prev);
    return [value, toggle];
  }
  ```
- Optional, create a "barrel file" `index.js` so that you can import it in a nicer way
  ```js
  // hooks/index.js
  export { default as useToggle } from './useToggle.js';
  export { default as useWhatever } from './useWhatever.js';
  ```

  ```js
  // above allows to nicely import it elsewhere 
  import { useToggle, useWhatever } from '../hooks/index.js';
  ```

# Homework

- Refactor the weather app we did for our first exercise (see https://codepen.io/codevilla/pen/YPyWWpm) into the following components.  Then separate the css into its respective components that you created.
Feel free to create more components inside `<Forecast>` as you see fit.  FYI - ignore my `this.whatever` or `this.state.whatever` code below since I was using class-based React which you won't be using.
  ```jsx
  return (
      <div>
        <header>
          <Nav city={this.state.currentCity} handleCityChange={this.changeCity} />
        </header>
        <main>
          <TodayWeather
            city={this.state.currentCity}
            handleCoordsChange={this.changeCoords}
          />
          <Forecast lat={this.state.lat} lon={this.state.lon} />
        </main>
      </div>
    );
  ```
